\# Git Workflow Documentation



\## GitFlow vs GitHub Flow

GitFlow uses multiple branches like main, develop, feature, release, and hotfix.

GitHub Flow is simpler and mainly uses feature branches merged directly to main.



\## Rebase vs Merge

Merge keeps full history and is useful for shared branches.

Rebase creates a cleaner history and is preferred for local feature branches.
